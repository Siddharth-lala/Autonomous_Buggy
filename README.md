# Autonomous_Buggy
The goal of the project was to create a buggy capable of a certain level of autonomous driving.

The overall module was split into 3 challenges:
Ø Bronze Challenge
Ø Silver Challenge
Ø Gold Challenge

The bronze challenge required us to a properly wire our buggy as well as use the ultrasonic
sensors and the IR sensors to follow a line and stop at an appropriate distance from an obstacle.
It also required us to connect our buggy to a control laptop over WiFi and to create a GUI in
Processing that would receive data from the buggy and send commands to it. The silver
challenge took this concept one step further and tasked us with implementing a PID controller to
allow the buggy to follow an object at a safe distance. The gold challenge was more open ended
and only required that we make use of the IMU, everything else was left to our imagination.
